Often in biophysical simulations a lot of excess water doesn't need to be simulated after complex formation, but deleting all of it would destroy the nice water structure around eventual macromolecules. This python script keeps a user specified amount of solvent molecules around the complex and reports the approx. distance to the outer solv. shell.
